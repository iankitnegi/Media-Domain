# Problem Statement  
Atliq media is a private media company and they wanted to telecast a show on Lok Sabha election 2024 in India. Unlike other channels they do not want to have a debate on who is going to win the election, they rather wanted to present insights from 2014 and 2019 elections without any bias and discuss less explored themes like voter turnout percentage in India.  

## 1. ASK  
Stakeholder: Bruce Haryali (Atliq CEO)  

### Questions:  
* List top 5/ bottom 5 constituencies of 2014 and 2019 in terms of voter turnout ratio?

Microsoft Excel was used to clean and transform raw data.




## 4. ANALYZE  
### Key Metrics:  
* Voter Turnout Ratio: This metric represents the percentage of registered voters who actually cast their votes in an election. It is calculated by dividing the total number of votes cast (general votes plus postal votes) by the total number of registered electors in a constituency, and then multiplying by 100 to convert it into a percentage. This ratio is a crucial indicator of voter engagement and participation in the democratic process.  
Voter Turnout Ratio = (Total Votes Cast / Total Electors)Ã— 100%
